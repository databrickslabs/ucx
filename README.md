# UCX - Unity Catalog Migration Toolkit

Your best companion for enabling the Unity Catalog.

## Installation

The `./install.sh` script will guide you through installation process. Make sure you have Python 3.10 (or greater) 
installed on your workstation, and you've configured authentication for 
the [Databricks Workspace](https://databricks-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html#default-authentication-flow).

The easiest way to install and authenticate is through a [Databricks configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication):

```shell
export DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=ABC
./install.sh
```

You can also specify environment variables in a more direct way, like in this example for installing 
on a Azure Databricks Workspace using the Azure CLI authentication:

```shell
az login
export DATABRICKS_HOST=https://adb-123....azuredatabricks.net/
./install.sh
```
