See [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md) to help improve this project.

## Introduction
UCX will guide you, the Databricks customer through the process of upgrading your account, groups, workspaces, jobs etc to Unity Catalog. 

1. The upgrade process will first install code, libraries, and workflows into your workspace.
2. After installation, you will run a series of workflows and examine the output.

UCX leverages Databricks Lakehouse platform to upgrade itself, this includes creating jobs, notebooks, deploying code and configuration files. The `install.sh` guides you through the installation.

By running the installation you install the assessment job and a number of upgrade jobs. The assessment and upgrade jobs are outlined in the custom generated README.py that is created by the installer and displayed to you by the `install.sh`. See interactive installation [tutorial here](https://app.getreprise.com/launch/G6YbWLn/). 


The custom generated README.py, config.yaml and other assets are placed into your Databricks workspace home folder, into a subfolder named `.ucx`. See [interactive tutorial](https://app.getreprise.com/launch/zXPxBZX/).


Once the custom Databricks jobs are installed, begin by triggering the assessment job. The assessment job can be found under your workflows or via the active link in the README.py. Once the assessment job is complete, you can review the results in the custom generated Databricks dashboard (linked to by the custom README.py found in the workspace folder created for you).


You will need account, unity catalog and workspace administrative authority to complete the upgrade process. To run the installer, you will need to setup `databricks-cli` and a credential, [following these instructions.](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html) Additionally, the interim metadata and config data being processed by UCX will be stored into a Hive Metastore database schema generated at install time.


For questions, troubleshooting or bug fixes, please see your Databricks account team or submit an issue to the [Databricks UCX github repo](https://github.com/databrickslabs/ucx)

### Download & Install
As a customer, download the [latest release](https://github.com/databrickslabs/ucx/releases) from github onto your laptop/desktop machine. Unzip or untar the release.

The `./install.sh` script will guide you through installation process. 
Make sure you have Python 3.10 (or greater) installed on your workstation, and you've configured authentication for 
the [Databricks Workspace](https://databricks-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html#default-authentication-flow).

![install wizard](docs/ucx-install.gif)

The easiest way to install and authenticate is through a [Databricks configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication):

```shell
export DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=ABC
./install.sh
```

You can also specify environment variables in a more direct way, like in this example for installing 
on an Azure Databricks Workspace using the Azure CLI authentication:

```shell
az login
export DATABRICKS_HOST=https://adb-123....azuredatabricks.net/
./install.sh
```

Please follow the instructions in `./install.sh`, which will deploy UCX to your workspace and open a notebook with the description of all jobs to trigger. The journey starts with assessment.
