        have already been migrated over to the account group, and the other half of the permissions are still with
        the workspace local group. Addressing cases like this would require two options that both require manual
        intervention:
          - Deleting all conflicting permissions for the account group, rerun the permission migration between
            the workspace and account group (the workflow is idempotent).
          - Creating a new account group, reverting all the permissions that were migrated over to the old account
            group, and running the workflow again.

        To make things run smoothly, this workflow should never be run on an account group that already has permissions.
