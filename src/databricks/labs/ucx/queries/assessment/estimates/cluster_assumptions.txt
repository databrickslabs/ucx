Assumptions for a single cluster upgrade estimates:

- Efforts to adapt code that are submitted to the cluster are out of scope
- GRANTS has been set-up on appropriate groups to target UC objects

Scope of the upgrade estimate:

- Choosing appropriate target DBR version
- Recreate the cluster to a supported type
- Removing unsupported configurations
- Rewriting cluster policy (if any)
