Assumptions for a single DLT upgrade estimate:

- If the cluster authenticates to a service principal, objects and grants has been set to the target user(s) to access the data.
- Historical data in Hive Metastore has been copied to the target UC destination in Managed Tables (see Table upgrade).
- GRANTS has been set on appropriate tables to the identity that will run the pipeline.

Scope of the upgrade estimate:

- Recreate the DLT pipeline to use a UC Target Schema
- Removes any references to a service principal
