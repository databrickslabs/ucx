- Historical data in Hive Metastore has been copied to the target UC destination in Managed Tables (see Table upgrade).
- GRANTS has been set on appropriate tables to the identity that will run the pipeline.

Scope of the upgrade estimate:

- Recreate the DLT pipeline to use a UC Target Schema
- Removes any references to a service principal
