# 1. Migration readiness

The migration readiness percentages show the relative amount of resources that is ready **to be** migrated. For example,
a job can only be migrated if its runtime version is Unity Catalog compatible, if the runtime version is not up-to-date
the code that the job runs cannot be migrated.
