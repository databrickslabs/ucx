# Migration progress

This dashboard shows the migration progress. The data visualized is updated by the `migration-progress-experimental`
workflow. This workflow is expected to run regularly, like daily or weekly, to keep an up-to-date overview of how the
migration is progressing.

Besides given an up-to-date status of the migration progress, the dashboards also facilitates
planning and dividing the work. For example, one my can chose to migrate a single data workspace at a time. By making
someone the migration `owner` of each workspace, the dashboards shows how the resources assigned to the owner are
progressing.
