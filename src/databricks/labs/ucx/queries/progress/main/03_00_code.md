# Code

This section shows Unity Catalog compatability issues found while linting code. There are two kinds of code changes to
perform:
- Data asset reference, like references to Hive metastore tables and views or direct filesystem access (dfsa). These
  references should be updated to refer to their Unity Catalog counterparts.
- Linting compatability issues, like using RDDs or directly accessing the Spark context. These issues should be resolved
  by following the instructions stated with the issue.
