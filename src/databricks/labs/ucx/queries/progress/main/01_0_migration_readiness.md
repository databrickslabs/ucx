# 1. Migration Readiness

The migration readiness percentages indicate the relative amount of resources that are ready **to be** migrated. For
instance, a job can only be migrated if its runtime version is compatible with Unity Catalog. If the runtime version is
not up-to-date, the code executed by the job cannot be migrated.
