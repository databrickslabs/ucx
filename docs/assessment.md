### AF001 - DBR ...
Short description: The compute runtime does not meet the requirements to use Unity Catalog.
Explanation: Unity Catalog capabilities are fully enabled on Databricks Runtime 13.3 LTS. This is the current recommended runtime for production interactive clusters and jobs. This finding is noting the cluster or job compute configuration does not meet this threshold. 
recommendation: Upgrade the DBR version to 13.3 LTS or later.


### AF020 Inplace Sync
Short description: We found that the table or database can be SYNC'd without moving data because the data is stored directly on cloud storage specified via a mount or a cloud storage URL (not DBFS).
How: Run the SYNC command on the table or schema.  If the tables (or source database) is 'managed' first set this spark setting in your session or in the interactive cluster configuration: `spark.databricks.sync.command.enableManagedTable=true`
