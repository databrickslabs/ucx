At the end of the installation, the user will be prompted if the current installation needs to join an existing collection (or create new collection if none present).

For large organization with many workspaces, grouping workspaces into collection helps in managing UCX migration at collection level (instead of workspaces level)

User should be an account admin to be able to join a collection.
