Part of this application is deployed as [Databricks Workflows](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workflows/index.html).
You can view the status of deployed workflows via the [`workflows` command](docs/reference/commands.md#workflows).
Failed workflows can be fixed with the [`repair-run` command](docs/reference/commands.md##repair-run).
