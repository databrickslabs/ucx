# Workflows

Part of this application is deployed as [Databricks Workflows](https://docs.databricks.com/en/workflows/index.html).
You can view the status of deployed workflows via the [`workflows` command](#workflows-command).
Failed workflows can be fixed with the [`repair-run` command](#repair-run-command).
