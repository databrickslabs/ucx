# Table migration commands

These commands are vital part of [table migration process](#Table-Migration) process and require
the [assessment workflow](#assessment-workflow) and
[group migration workflow](#group-migration-workflow) to be completed.
See the [migration process diagram](#migration-process) to understand the role of the table migration commands in
the migration process.

The first step is to run the [`principal-prefix-access` command](#principal-prefix-access-command) to identify all
the storage accounts used by tables in the workspace and their permissions on each storage account.

If you don't have any storage credentials and external locations configured,  you'll need to run
the [`migrate-credentials` command](#migrate-credentials-command) to migrate the service principals
and [`migrate-locations` command](#migrate-locations-command) to create the external locations.
If some of the external locations already exist, you should run
the [`validate-external-locations` command](#validate-external-locations-command).
You'll need to create the [uber principal](#create-uber-principal-command) with the _**access to all storage**_ used to tables in
the workspace, so that you can migrate all the tables. If you already have the principal, you can skip this step.

Ask your Databricks Account admin to run the [`sync-workspace-info` command](#sync-workspace-info-command) to sync the
workspace information with the UCX installations. Once the workspace information is synced, you can run the
[`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) to align your tables with the Unity Catalog,
[create catalogs and schemas](#create-catalogs-schemas-command) and start the migration using [`migrate-tables` command](#migrate-tables-command). During multiple runs of
the table migration workflow, you can use the [`revert-migrated-tables` command](#revert-migrated-tables-command) to
revert the tables that were migrated in the previous run. You can also skip the tables that you don't want to migrate
using the [`skip` command](#skip-command).

Once you're done with the table migration, proceed to the [code migration](#code-migration-commands).



## `principal-prefix-access` command

```text
databricks labs ucx principal-prefix-access [--subscription-ids <Azure Subscription ID>] [--aws-profile <AWS CLI profile>]
```

This command depends on results from the [assessment workflow](#assessment-workflow) and requires [AWS CLI](#access-for-aws-s3-buckets)
or [Azure CLI](#access-for-azure-storage-accounts) to be installed and authenticated for the given machine. This command
identifies all the storage accounts used by tables in the workspace and their permissions on each storage account.
Once you're done running this command, proceed to the [`migrate-credentials` command](#migrate-credentials-command).

The "prefix" refers to the start - i.e. prefix - of table locations that point to the cloud storage location.



### Access for AWS S3 Buckets

```commandline
databricks labs ucx principal-prefix-access --aws-profile test-profile
```

Use to identify all instance profiles in the workspace, and map their access to S3 buckets.
Also captures the IAM roles which has UC arn listed, and map their access to S3 buckets
This requires `aws` CLI to be installed and configured.

For AWS this command produces a file named `aws_instance_profile_info.csv`.
It has the following format:

| **role_arn**                                         | **resource_type** | **privilege** | **resource_path**     |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| arn:aws:iam::1234:instance-profile/instance-profile1 | s3                | WRITE_FILES   | s3://s3_bucket1/path1 |


Once done, proceed to the [`migrate-credentials` command](#migrate-credentials-command).



### Access for Azure Storage Accounts

```commandline
databricks labs ucx principal-prefix-access --subscription-ids test-subscription-id
```

Use to identify all storage account used by tables, identify the relevant Azure service principals and their permissions
on each storage account. The command is used to identify Azure Service Principals, which have `Storage Blob Data Contributor`,
`Storage Blob Data Reader`, `Storage Blob Data Owner` roles, or custom read/write roles on ADLS Gen2 locations that are being
used in Databricks. This requires Azure CLI to be installed and configured via `az login`. It outputs azure_storage_account_info.csv
which will be later used by migrate-credentials command to create UC storage credentials.
Note: This cmd only lists azure storage account gen2, storage format wasb:// or adl:// are not supported in UC and those storage info
will be skipped.

Once done, proceed to the [`migrate-credentials` command](#migrate-credentials-command).



## `create-missing-principals` command (AWS Only)
```bash
databricks labs ucx create-missing-principals --aws-profile <aws_profile> --single-role <single_role>
```
This command identifies all the S3 locations that are missing a UC compatible role and creates them.
It takes single-role optional parameter.
If set to True, it will create a single role for all the S3 locations.
Otherwise, it will create a role for each S3 location.

Two optional parameter are available for this command:
`--role-name` - This parameter is used to set the prefix for the role name. The default value is `UCX-ROLE`.
`--role-policy` - This parameter is used to set the prefix for the role policy name. The default value is `UCX-POLICY`.



## `delete-missing-principals` command (AWS Only)
```bash
databricks labs ucx delete-missing-principals --aws-profile <aws_profile>
```
This command helps to delete the IAM role created by UCX. It lists all the IAM Roles generated by the principal-prefix-access
command and allows user to select multiple roles to delete. It also checks if selected roles are mapped to any storage credentials
and asks for confirmation from user. Once confirmed, it deletes the role and its associated inline policy.



## `create-uber-principal` command

```text
databricks labs ucx create-uber-principal [--subscription-ids X]
```

**Requires Cloud IAM admin privileges.**

Once the [`assessment` workflow](#assessment-workflow) complete, you should run this command to create a service principal with the
_**read-only access to all storage**_ used by tables in this workspace. It will also configure the
[UCX Cluster Policy](#installation) & SQL Warehouse data access configuration to use this service principal for migration
workflows. Once migration is complete, this service principal should be unprovisioned.

On Azure, it creates a principal with `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role assignment on every storage account using
Azure Resource Manager APIs.

This command is one of prerequisites for the [table migration process](#table-migration).



## `migrate-credentials` command

```commandline
databricks labs ucx migrate-credentials
```

For Azure, this command prompts to confirm performing the following credential migration steps:
1. [RECOMMENDED] For each storage account, create access connectors with managed identities that have the
   `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role on the respective storage account. A storage credential is created for each
    access connector.
2. Migrate Azure Service Principals, which have `Storage Blob Data Contributor`,
   `Storage Blob Data Reader`, `Storage Blob Data Owner`, or custom roles on ADLS Gen2 locations that are being used in
   Databricks, to UC storage credentials. The Azure Service Principals to location mapping are listed
   in `/Users/{user_name}/.ucx/azure_storage_account_info.csv` which is generated by
   [`principal-prefix-access` command](#principal-prefix-access-command). Please review the file and delete the Service
   Principals you do not want to be migrated. The command will only migrate the Service Principals that have client
   secret stored in Databricks Secret.

  **Warning**: Service principals used to access storage accounts behind firewalls might cause connectivity issues. We
  recommend to use access connectors instead.

For AWS, this command migrates AWS Instance Profiles that are being used in Databricks, to UC storage credentials.
The AWS Instance Profiles to location mapping are listed in
`{workspace ucx folder}/aws_instance_profile_info.csv` which is generated by principal_prefix_access command.
Please review the file and delete the Instance Profiles you do not want to be migrated. <br/>The aws_profile parameter indicates the aws profile to use.

Once you're done with this command, run [`validate-external-locations` command](#validate-external-locations-command) after this one.



## `validate-external-locations` command

```text
databricks labs ucx validate-external-locations
```

Once the [`assessment` workflow](#assessment-workflow) finished successfully, [storage credentials](#migrate-credentials-command) are configured,
run this command to validate and report the missing Unity Catalog external locations to be created.

This command validates and provides mapping to external tables to external locations, also as Terraform configurations.

Once you're done with this command, proceed to the [`migrate-locations` command](#migrate-locations-command).



## `migrate-locations` command

```text
databricks labs ucx migrate-locations
```

Once the [`assessment` workflow](#assessment-workflow) finished successfully, and [storage credentials](#migrate-credentials-command) are configured,
run this command to have Unity Catalog external locations created. The candidate locations to be created are extracted from guess_external_locations
task in the assessment job. You can run [`validate-external-locations` command](#validate-external-locations-command) to check the candidate locations.

**Location ACLs:**
`migrate-locations` command applies any location ACL from existing cluster.
For Azure, it checks if there are any interactive cluster or SQL warehouse
which has service principals configured to access storage. It maps the storage account to the external location created and grants `CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE`,
`CREATE_EXTERNAL_VOLUME` and `READ_FILES` permission on the location to all the user who have access to the interactive cluster or SQL warehouse
For AWS, it checks any instance profiles mapped to the interactive cluster or SQL warehouse. It checks the mapping of instance profiles to the bucket. It then
maps the bucket to the external locations created and grants `CREATE_EXTERNAL_TABLE`, `CREATE_EXTERNAL_VOLUME` and `READ_FILES` permission on the location to all the user who have access to the interactive cluster
or SQL warehouse

Once you're done with this command, proceed to the [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command).



## `create-table-mapping` command

```text
databricks labs ucx create-table-mapping
```

Once the [`assessment` workflow](#assessment-workflow) finished successfully
[workspace info is synchronized](#sync-workspace-info-command), run this command to create the initial
table mapping for review in CSV format in the Databricks Workspace:

```text
workspace_name,catalog_name,src_schema,dst_schema,src_table,dst_table
labs-azure,labs_azure,default,default,ucx_tybzs,ucx_tybzs
```

The format of the mapping file is as follows:

| **columns:** | **workspace_name**      | **catalog_name** | **src_schema** | **dst_schema** | **src_table** | **dst_table** |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| values:      | data_engineering_ws | de_catalog   | database1      | database1      | table1        | table1        |

You are supposed to review this mapping and adjust it if necessary. This file is in CSV format, so that you can edit it
easier in your favorite spreadsheet application.

Once you're done with this command, [create catalogs and schemas](#create-catalogs-schemas-command). During
multiple runs of the table migration workflow, you can use the [`revert-migrated-tables` command](#revert-migrated-tables-command)
to revert the tables that were migrated in the previous run. You can also skip the tables that you don't want to migrate
using the [`skip` command](#skip-command).

This command is one of prerequisites for the [table migration process](#Table-Migration).

Once you're done with table migration, proceed to the [code migration](#code-migration-commands).



## `skip` command

```text
databricks labs ucx skip --schema X [--table Y] [--view Z]
```

Anytime after [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) is executed, you can run this command.

This command allows users to skip certain schemas, tables or views during the [table migration](#table-migration) process.
The command takes `--schema` and, optionally, `--table` and `--view` flags to specify the schema, table or view to skip.
If no `--table` flag is provided, all tables in the specified HMS database are skipped. The `--table` and `--view` can
only be used exclusively. This command is useful to temporarily disable migration of a particular schema, table or view.

Once you're done with table migration, proceed to the [code migration](#code-migration-commands).



## `unskip` command

```commandline
databricks labs ucx unskip --schema X [--table Y] [--view Z]
```

This command removes the mark set by the [`skip` command](#skip-command) on the given schema, table or view.



## `create-catalogs-schemas` command

```text
databricks labs ucx create-catalogs-schemas
```
After [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) is executed, you can run this command to have the required UC catalogs and schemas created.
This command is supposed to be run before migrating tables to UC using [table migration process](#Table-Migration).
Catalog & Schema ACL:
`create-catalogs-schemas` command also applies any catalog and schema ACL from existing clusters.
For Azure it checks if there are any interactive cluster or sql warehouse which has service principals configured to access storage.
It maps the storage account to the tables which has external location on those storage account created and grants `USAGE` access to
the schema and catalog if at least one such table is migrated to it.
For AWS, it checks any instance profiles mapped to the interactive cluster or sql warehouse. It checks the mapping of instance profiles
to the bucket. It then maps the bucket to the tables which has external location on those bucket created and grants `USAGE` access to
the schema and catalog if at least one such table is migrated to it.


## `assign-owner-group` command

```text
databricks labs ucx assign-owner-group
```

This command assigns the owner group to the UCX catalog and all migrated tables.
The owner group is an account group that will be designated as an owner to all migrated objects (catalogs, schemas, tables, views).
The principal running the command and later, the migration workflows, is required to be a member of this group.
The command will list all the groups the principal is a member of and allow the selection of the owner group.
It sets the default_owner_group property in the config.yml file.



## `migrate-tables` command

```text
databricks labs ucx migrate-tables
```

Anytime after [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) is executed, you can run this command.

This command kicks off the [table migration](#Table-Migration) process. It triggers the `migrate-tables` workflow,
and if there are HiveSerDe tables detected, prompt whether to trigger the `migrate-external-hiveserde-tables-in-place-experimental` workflow.

Table and View ACL:
`migrate-tables` command also applies any table and view ACL from existing clusters.
For Azure it checks if there are any interactive cluster or sql warehouse which has service principals configured to access storage.
It maps the storage account to the tables which has external location on those storage account created and grants either `SELECT` permission if
the service principal only has read access on the storage account and `ALL_PRIVILEGES` if the service principal has write access on the storage account
For AWS, it checks any instance profiles mapped to the interactive cluster or sql warehouse. It checks the mapping of instance profiles
to the bucket. It then maps the bucket to the tables which has external location on those bucket created and grants either `SELECT` permission if
the instance profile only has read access on the bucket and `ALL_PRIVILEGES` if the instance profile has write access on the bucket.



## `revert-migrated-tables` command

```text
databricks labs ucx revert-migrated-tables --schema X --table Y [--delete-managed]
```

Anytime after [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) is executed, you can run this command.

This command removes the `upgraded_from` property on a migrated table for re-migration in the [table migration](#Table-Migration) process.
This command is useful for developers and administrators who want to revert the migration of a table. It can also be used
to debug issues related to table migration.

Go back to the [`create-table-mapping` command](#create-table-mapping-command) after you're done with this command.



## `move` command

```text
databricks labs ucx move --from-catalog A --from-schema B --from-table C --to-catalog D --to-schema E
```

This command moves a UC table/tables from one schema to another schema after
the [table migration](#Table-Migration) process. This is useful for developers and administrators who want
to adjust their catalog structure after tables upgrade.

Users will be prompted whether tables/view are dropped after moving to new schema. This only applies to `MANAGED` tables and views.

This command moves different table types differently:
- `MANAGED` tables are deep-cloned to the new schema.
- `EXTERNAL` tables are dropped from the original schema, then created in the target schema using the same location.
This is due to Unity Catalog not supporting multiple tables with overlapping paths
- `VIEW` are recreated using the same view definition.

This command supports moving multiple tables at once, by specifying `*` as the table name.



## `alias` command

```text
databricks labs ucx alias --from-catalog A --from-schema B --from-table C --to-catalog D --to-schema E
```

This command aliases a UC table/tables from one schema to another schema in the same or different catalog.
It takes a `WorkspaceClient` object and `from` and `to` parameters as parameters and aliases the tables using
the `TableMove` class. This command is useful for developers and administrators who want to create an alias for a table.
It can also be used to debug issues related to table aliasing.
