## Assigned Clusters or Single User Clusters
"Assigned Clusters" are Interactive clusters assigned to a single principal. Implicit in this term is that these clusters are enabled for Unity Catalog. Publicly available today, "Assigned Clusters" can be assigned to a user and the user's identity is used to access data resources. The access to the cluster is restricted to that single user to ensure accountability and accuracy of the audit logs.

"Single User Clusters" are Interactive clusters that name one specific user account as user.

The `data_security_mode` for these clusters are `SINGLE_USER`

## Shared Clusters
"Shared Clusters are Interactive or Job clusters with an access mode of "SHARED".


The `data_security_mode` for these clusters are `USER_ISOLATION`.
