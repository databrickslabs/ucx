# Authoring Documentation

This document provides guidelines for writing documentation for the UCX project.


## Tech Stack

The UCX documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator. Docusaurus is a project of Facebook Open Source and is used by many open-source projects to build their documentation websites.
We also use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write markdown files that include JSX components. This allows us to write markdown files with embedded React components.
For styling, we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Writing Documentation

Most of the documentation is written in markdown files with the `.mdx` extension. 
The markdown files are located in the `docs` directory of the UCX project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start writing documentation, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

On macOS, you can install Node.js and Yarn using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install node
npm install --global yarn
```


## Setup 

To set up the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the UCX repository
2. Run:

```bash
make docs-install
```

## Running the Documentation Locally

To run the documentation locally, use the following command:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

## Adding images

To add images to your documentation, place the image files in the `static/img` directory.

To include an image in your markdown file, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/img/image-name.png)
```

## Linking pages

It is **strongly** recommended to make all links absolute. 
By doing so we ensure that it's easy to move files without losing links inside them. 

To add an absolute link, use this syntax:

```md
[link text](/docs/folder/file_name)
```

Always start with `/docs`. The file extension `.md` or `.mdx` can be omitted. 

To add an anchor to a specific heading, use this syntax:

```md
[link with anchor](/docs/folder/file_name#anchor)
```

After writing docs, run this command:

```
make docs-build
```

It will throw an error on any unresolved link. 


## Content alignment and structure of folders

When writing documentation, make sure to align the content with the existing documentation.

The rule of thumb is:

<div className="text-red-700 p-4 dark:text-red-400 flex justify-center items-center">
    <div className='max-w-screen-sm text-center text-balance'>
        <div className="text-2xl font-bold font-mono text-balance">
            Do not put any technical details in the main documentation.
        </div>
        <div className="text-lg font-mono">
        All technical details should be kept in <code>/docs/dev/</code> section.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

No need for:
- Source code links 
- Deep technical details
- Implementation details

Or any other details that are not necessary for the **end-user**.
