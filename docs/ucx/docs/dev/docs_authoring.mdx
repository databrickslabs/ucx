# Authoring Documentation

This document provides guidelines for writing documentation for the UCX project.


## Tech Stack

The UCX documentation is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static site generator. Docusaurus is a project of Facebook Open Source and is used by many open-source projects to build their documentation websites.
We also use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write markdown files that include JSX components. This allows us to write markdown files with embedded React components.
For styling, we use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Writing Documentation

Most of the documentation is written in markdown files with the `.mdx` extension. 
The markdown files are located in the `docs` directory of the UCX project.

## Prerequisites

Before you start writing documentation, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

On macOS, you can install Node.js and Yarn using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install node
npm install --global yarn
```


## Setup 

To set up the documentation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the UCX repository
2. Run:

```bash
make docs-install
```

## Running the Documentation Locally

To run the documentation locally, use the following command:

```bash
make docs-serve
```

## Adding images

To add images to your documentation, place the image files in the `static/img` directory.

To include an image in your markdown file, use the following syntax:

```markdown
![Alt text](/img/image-name.png)
```
