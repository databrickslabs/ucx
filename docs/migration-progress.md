# Migration progress

UCX tracks migration progress of _business_ resources: workspace resources that contribute to business value.
(The term "business resource" comes from the UCX team and is **not** Databricks terminology.) We identified the
following business resources:

| Workspace resource         | Motivation                                                                                                                  |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard                  | Dashboards visualize data models supporting business processes                                                              |
| Job                        | Jobs create data models supporting business process - not exclusively data models used by dashboards.                       |
| Delta Live Table pipelines | Delta Live Table pipelines create data models supporting business process - not exclusively data models used by dashboards. |
