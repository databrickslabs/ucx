## Some calls that use a variable whose value is unknown: they could potentially reference a migrated table.
# ucx[table-migrate:+1:0:+1:0] Can't migrate 'cacheTable' because its table name argument is not a constant

# FIXME: This is a false positive; any method named 'cacheTable' is triggering the warning.
